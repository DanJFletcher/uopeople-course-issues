# uopeople-course-issues

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of issues in University of the People courses:
- Broken links
- Typos/spelling errors
- Ambiguous assignment descriptions
- etc

To start contributing click on the issues tab, and then create an issue. The title of your issue should be formatted like this:
`<course code> <unit> <topic> <type of issue>`

For example:
> CS4402 Unit 1 reading assignment: Topics in History links to 403 Forbidden

Then describe the issue in greater detail inside the body of the issue.  
For example:  
> Unit 1's reading assignment asks students to read the contents of this link: http://hhh.gavilan.edu/dvantassel/history/history.html
>
> Unfortunately following that link will give a 403 forbidden error. This link is listed under "required" so either authorization issues need to be addressed, or an alternative needs to be supplied.

Another important detail to provide would be an alternative resource if the linked one is missing. Many times, links are meant to bring us to a PDF copy of a text book. If that link is broken, see about finding an alternative place where that PDF may exist, and provide a link to that resource when submitting your issue, so that other students can find it with less hassle.
