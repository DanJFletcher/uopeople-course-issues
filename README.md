# uopeople-course-issues

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of issues in University of the People courses:
- Broken links
- Typos/spelling errors
- Ambiguous assignment descriptions
- etc

To start contributing click on the issues tab, and then create an issue. The title of your issue should be formatted like this:
`<course code> <unit> <topic> <type of issue>`

For example:
> CS4402 Unit 1 reading assignment: Topics in History links to 403 Forbidden

Then describe the issue in greater detail inside the body of the issue.  
For example:  
> Unit 1's reading assignment asks students to read the contents of this link: http://hhh.gavilan.edu/dvantassel/history/history.html
>
> Unfortunately following that link will give a 403 forbidden error. This link is listed under "required" so either authorization issues need to be addressed, or an alternative needs to be supplied.
